# AGENTS.md — Agent configuration for django-object-preferences

Preferences stored on any Django model instance, declared with forms. Each
record keeps its preferences in one JSON field, and each installed app declares
its own preference group with a Django form. The package depends on Django
alone and knows nothing about any user interface package. Who may change a
record's preferences is the host project's decision, never this package's.

## Stack and commands

- **Stack:** Python 3.12+ / Django 5.2, 6.0 and 6.1, uv-managed (hatchling build backend), with
  no runtime dependency beyond Django
- **Install:** `uv sync`
- **Test (whole suite):** `uv run pytest -n auto --dist loadscope`
- **Test (one class or file, while iterating):** `uv run pytest <path> -x` —
  serial, because starting the workers costs more than a focused run takes
- **Lint:** `uv run pre-commit run --all-files`
- **Type-check:** `uv run mypy`
- **Build:** `uv build`
- **Bump the version:** `uv version` — never edit `pyproject.toml` alone, because `uv.lock`
  records this package's own version too

Lint is the pre-commit run rather than a bare `ruff check .`: the hook config
excludes `docs/` and migrations, so a raw invocation reports findings in paths
the gate does not cover, and they cannot be fixed without breaking the ones it
does.

`pre-commit run --all-files` only sees files git knows about. A new file that
has not been added is skipped, and the hooks then reformat it after the commit
that introduced it.

## Releasing

Releases run through the shared release flow, never by hand and never by
pushing a tag.

1. Dispatch **Prepare Release** with a bump level. It opens a pull request
   carrying the version bump and the CHANGELOG section.
2. Merging that pull request is the release decision. **Tag Release** then cuts
   the tag and the GitHub Release from the merge commit.
3. **Publish** uploads to PyPI through trusted publishing. PyPI binds its
   trusted publisher to the `publish.yml` filename — renaming that file breaks
   publishing until the PyPI project settings are changed to match.

`pyproject.toml` holds the version and is the single source of truth for all
three steps.

**Tag Release skips a version with no matching CHANGELOG section**, which is
what stops the seed version being cut as a release. Leave it under
`## [Unreleased]` until Prepare Release promotes it: writing a `## [0.0.1]`
heading by hand makes the next push to `pyproject.toml` tag and release it.

Two things are needed before the first release: a PyPI trusted publisher for
this project pointed at `publish.yml`, and a `RELEASE_TOKEN` secret that can
write to this repository.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues tracked in GitHub Issues via the `gh` CLI. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

`needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`.
See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

One `CONTEXT.md` at the repository root and `docs/adr/` for decisions.
See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

### CI checks

CI runs from the shared reusable workflows in `django-mvp/shared`, pinned at
`v0.6.0`. Because they are called rather than inlined,
their status checks carry the calling job as a prefix. The required checks are:

- `call-build / Code Quality`
- `call-build / Security Scan`
- `call-build / Build Package`
- `call-tests / Test Python 3.12, Django 5.2`
- `call-tests / Test Python 3.12, Django 6.0`
- `call-tests / Test Python 3.13, Django 5.2`
- `call-tests / Test Python 3.13, Django 6.0`
- `call-tests / Test Python 3.12, Django 6.1`
- `call-tests / Test Python 3.13, Django 6.1`

`tests.yml` and `build.yml` deliberately carry no `paths:` filter on
`pull_request`. A required check that is filtered out never reports, and a
check that never reports blocks the merge.

## Working here

Standards and the quality bar live in `CONSTITUTION.md`. The vocabulary to use
in issues, commits and test names lives in `CONTEXT.md`. What the package is
trying to be good at lives in `GOALS.md`, and the order the work happens in
lives in `docs/ROADMAP.md`.
